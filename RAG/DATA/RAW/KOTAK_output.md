The Terms shall be available at the Bank branches. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Bank may at its sole discretion add to, modify or amend the Terms (including the Charges) from time to time and such changes shall be communicated to the Customer by display in the Bank premises or on the website, but individual communication may not be sent to him. The Bank may publish notices of general nature, which are applicable to the Customers on Bank's Website or on its notice board or in any other mode as may be decided by the Bank. Such communication and notices would have the same effect as a notice served individually to each Customer.

Reserve Bank of India has a clear stance on Virtual Currencies (VCs) – that these currencies do not have any regulatory permission or protection in India. In its latest circular (dated April 6, 2018), the RBI has directed that the entities that it regulates shall not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs. These services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer/receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase / sale of VCs. We at Kotak Mahindra Bank request you not to make any transaction involving virtual currencies from your bank account. However, if done so, under regulatory guidelines, the Bank would need to close your account without further intimation.
The Customer agrees that opening and maintenance of the Account and availing of Services is subject to the rules and regulations introduced or amended from time to time by the Reserve Bank of India or any other authority.
The opening of the Account is subject to verification, and Bank reserves the right to reject the request of the Applicant to open an Account without providing any reason. In the event where the documents submitted by the Applicants or Customers for opening an Account and/ or availing the Bank’s products and services or for processing the transactions thereon are incomplete or discrepant, Bank may at its discretion contact the Applicant for rectifying such discrepancies and/or for certain additional verification/ documentation requirements.

Premature Withdrawal of Fixed Deposit Home Fixed Deposit Premature Withdrawal of FD
Fixed deposit is the preferred choice for risk-averse investors, along with those who want to strike a balance in their investment portfolio. This investment option allows customers to earn guaranteed returns at pre-specified interest rates without having to bear market-related risks that come with other investment options like mutual funds. Fixed Deposits can be broadly categorized into two types – with premature withdrawal and without premature withdrawal facility.

Updated: 24-01-2025 10:19:53 AM
What is Premature Withdrawal
Fixed deposits , with a premature withdrawal facility, allow the depositor to close the FD before the date of maturity arrives. This comes as a relief in times of cash crunch.
However, a certain amount may be required to be paid by the depositor as a penalty to the bank. This usually ranges between 0.5% and 1%. Some banks do offer premature withdrawal facilities with zero penalty charges.
However, if the FD is prematurely closed, before completing 7 days from the date of the booking, the bank or the company is not liable to pay any interest.
Click here to know how to close the FD prematurely.
Penalty on Premature Withdrawal of FD
A penalty is a cost that is charged by the banks or companies when the depositor takes out the money from their bank prematurely or before the date of maturity. This is done to discourage frequent withdrawals and encourage the habit of saving.
How is a Penalty Levied
A penalty is levied on the interest to be paid to the depositor. However, the calculation for the penalty may vary from one bank to another. Most banks follow one of the two methods for penalty calculation as mentioned below:
Suppose a bank charges 1% penalty on premature withdrawals, so the calculation of the interest on premature withdrawal of the FD will be done as per the following illustration.
Case 1
Suppose a customer has invested in an FD of Rs. 1 lakh at a rate of 7% for 2 years. Let us also assume that the interest rate for 1 year is 6.5%. He withdraws the FD after completing 1 year. In one year, he has earned interest @ 7%. But now, the bank shall recalculate the interest at revised FD rates, i.e. 6.5% – 1%= 5.5%. The new rate will be 5.5% and interest shall be paid at this rate instead of the previous 7%.
Parameters
Details
Principal Amount
Rs. 1 lakh
Booked Interest Rate on a Two-year FD
7 per cent per annum

Interest Rate on One-year FD (at the time of booking an FD)
6.5 per cent per annum
Effective Rate of Interest
6.5 per cent per annum
Premature Withdrawal Penalty Charges
1 per cent
Final Rate of Interest Payable
5.5  per cent per annum
Amount Receivable on Premature Withdrawal
Rs. 1,05,614
Case 2
Suppose a customer has invested in an FD of Rs. 1 lakh at a rate of 6% for 2 years. Let us also assume that the interest rate for 1 year at the time of booking is 7% and the penalty rate for premature withdrawal is 1% of the effective rate of interest. The effective rate of interest is the lower of the rates at which the amount was booked and the rate for the tenure that the FD has remained in the bank.
He withdraws the FD after completing 1 year. In one year, he has earned interest @ 6%. But now, the bank shall recalculate the interest at an effective FD rate, i.e. 6% – 1%= 5%. The new rate will be 5% and interest shall be paid at this rate instead of the previous 6%.

Credit Card against FD – A better alternative to premature withdrawal
Why do we withdraw an FD? Or in other words, why do we break FD? We do it so as to handle a financial requirement. But what if we have a better alternative than to close our active FD account and lose on prospective returns?
A credit card against FD is that alternative which can help you in a financial emergency. Such cards are issued against your fixed deposit. Credit limit to such cards is usually 75-85% of the FD amount (principal). This way, you can cater to your needs while earning interest on your FD.
Paisabazaar Step UP is one such secured credit card against FD which is being offered to the customers in collaboration with the SBM Bank (India) Ltd. You can open an FD for a minimum amount of Rs. 12,000 and enjoy a flexible credit limit (~83% of FD amount).
Apart from helping in managing expenses, this credit card shall also help in building your credit score which shall eventually open more credit avenues for you in the future.
FD without premature withdrawal facility
Fixed deposits without premature withdrawal are usually with the higher deposit amount and the depositor is not allowed to close the FD before maturity. The rate of interest can be lower than the ones with a premature withdrawal option.
Some banks that have this facility are:
ICICI Bank Fixed Deposits (Rs. 2 crore and above)
HDFC Bank Fixed Deposits (Rs. 5 crore and above)
PNB Uttam Fixed Deposits: Non-Callable (Above Rs. 15 lakh)
Standard Chartered Fixed Deposits (Rs. 2 crore and above)
Banks such as ICICI Bank,  State Bank of India  (SBI),  Kotak Bank , HDFC Bank, etc. have specific terms and conditions for those who are willing to withdraw their money from the fixed deposits before the completion of the maturity period.
How to Close FD Prematurely
To exercise the premature withdrawal facility, there are two ways, viz. offline and online.
When it comes to the traditional method of offline withdrawal, customers are required to visit the branch of their respective banks and get their FD closed prematurely. For this, they are required to fill the form, submit documents, and surrender their Fixed Deposit Receipt.
Important points to be considered for the online mode:
Many banks allow online withdrawal only for deposits that were booked online in the first place (e.g. SBI e-TDR/e-STDR)
Internet banking should be enabled to use online mode for premature withdrawal of fixed deposit
Given below is a comprehensive comparison of the rules for premature withdrawal on Fixed Deposits by the leading banks in India:
Premature Withdrawal of SBI Fixed Deposit
The effective interest rate will be lower of 0.50-1% below the effective rate applicable at the time of booking the FD for the period the FD remained with the Bank or 0.50-1% below the contracted rate, whichever is lower
For retail term or fixed deposits amount up to Rs. 5 Lakh, the bank will charge a penalty of 0.50% for all tenure for premature withdrawal
For retail fixed deposits amount above Rs. 5 Lakh but below Rs. 1 crore, the applicable penalty is 1% for all tenures
The bank will not pay interest on deposits that remain for a period of fewer than 7 days
For more details about the withdrawal process and documents required for the same, call the customer care team of SBI at toll-free number 1800-425-3800, 1800-11-2211, and toll number 080-26599990.

Premature Withdrawal of HDFC Bank Fixed Deposit
The bank allows depositors to withdraw their invested amount before the completion of the maturity period via net-banking or simply by visiting the branch.
The effective rate of interest applicable for premature withdrawal of fixed deposits will be lesser of:
The base rate for the contracted/original tenure for which the amount has been booked, or
The base rate of interest applicable for the period for which the amount has been invested with HDFC Bank
Base Rate is the rate of interest applicable on Fixed Deposits on the day of booking the deposit
For premature withdrawals, partial withdrawals, and sweep-ins, the bank will levy 1% penalty on the rates applicable
No interest is paid if the FD is withdrawn before 7 days of booking

Disadvantages of Premature Withdrawal
When someone chooses to withdraw FD prematurely, one stands to lose on various fronts. These are explained here:
Penalties:  In case of premature withdrawal, the investor has to pay a certain amount as a penalty to the bank. The amount charged by the bank as a penalty is generally from 0.50 % to 1.00 % of the interest. The penalty may change over time as and when the bank decides to update its policies
Loss of Interest:  When an individual withdraws before maturity, they must know that they will not get the exact amount based on the rate of interest and duration of the fixed deposit because it has withdrawn before the tenure that was decided on the date of booking the FD. While calculating the amount you will receive after premature withdrawal, make sure to include the penalty charges as well
Halt to the Financial Growth:  Fixed Deposits are designed to provide the depositor with guaranteed returns in the form of interest on the date of maturity. If you have planned cash flow with a series of FDs, the premature withdrawal of the scheme will disturb your cash flow and might affect your budget
Premature Withdrawal is a Cumbersome Process:  Along with everything else, it is a fact that a premature withdrawal of the deposit is a cumbersome process and not a simple transaction. One has to go through several steps to complete the process. The formalities of the process include filling forms, meeting the officials of the bank, submitting documents, etc.

Premature Withdrawal of Fixed Deposit - Breaking FD Before Maturity - Kotak811 Savings How To Partially Withdraw Funds From Fixed Deposit Fixed Deposit or Term Deposit A fixed deposit is when you invest your lump sum money for a fixed period at a specified interest rate. When your fixed deposit’s term finishes you receive your invested amount with an interest. Investing in Fixed deposits is commonly seen as a secure and sought-after investment choice in  India. These investments are desirable due to their fixed rate of interest, and since they are non-market linked, the risk is virtually eliminated. Diversifying portfolios can be achieved by investing in fixed deposits, ensuring returns even during market volatility.  However, investors should research and examine their options, i ncluding understanding the implications of a premature withdrawal of FD,   before deciding if fixed deposit  or any other financial product is suitable for them. Must Read: Why Is Breaking Fixed Deposit Not A Wise Decision What is FD in bank? Popularly known as an FD or term deposit, the investment period for your FD varies from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 10 years. The return on your FD may be quarterly, monthly, or annually and will be credited into your account. The interest rate and duration of FD depends on your banking institution. Senior citizens get up to 0.5% higher returns.  You can withdraw your FD as and when required. However, this can affect the interest earned over the specified period. In case you want to withdraw your FD prematurely, here is how it goes: Premature Withdrawal of FD (Fixed Deposit) You can withdraw your FD upon maturity or prematurely. You may pull out or break your fixed deposit before the term ends. For a minimum period, the banks may not impose penalties. In case of fixed deposit withdrawal before maturity, banks may impose penalty charges of 0.50% to 1.00% on the interest rate on withdrawal of funds. Depending on your account type and the bank you invested in, you may or may not have to pay a penalty to the banking institution in case of premature withdrawal of FD.  If you have a tax savings account or a non-withdrawal FD account, withdrawal of funds is not allowed before the term period. Fixed deposit withdrawal before maturity can be claimed by submitting an FD Close Application with the bank. Kotak Mahindra Bank does not charge any interest on fixed deposit withdrawal if it is within seven days from its booking date, and your invested amount will be returned to your bank account. Kotak Mahindra Bank puts up a penalty of 0.50 % on the interest rate only if your deposit is invested for 181 days, and above and the withdrawal is before the term period.  The FD Withdrawal Application: Things To Keep In Mind When writing a withdrawal request for a fixed deposit withdrawal before maturity, you need to keep the following in mind: Verify all the information you have mentioned in the letter, especially the bank account numbers. You will need to submit the original fixed deposit bond or receipt to the bank. Describe your situation in the letter, if you have misplaced your original fixed deposit bond or receipt, or if you have a photocopy of the original. If the bank asks for additional proof of the reason for breaking the fixed deposit, please provide them. Withdrawal Procedure For Offline FDs: First and foremost, you need to request a withdrawal form from the bank where you opened your fixed deposit account. Fill out the withdrawal form with your name, bank account details, PAN, etc., and submit it along with your ID proof, photograph, and deposit certificate. You will receive the amount in your savings account once the bank approves your withdrawal form and documents. Withdrawal Procedure For Online FDs: Visit your bank's website. By providing the required credentials, you can log into your net banking account. Select the ‘Fixed Deposit’ option. Choose the FD account from which you wish to withdraw funds. You must then choose the premature withdrawal option in your FD account. The premature withdrawal section requires you to select the savings account from which you wish to transfer the funds to your FD account. You are done with your FD withdrawal once you click the submit option. The withdrawn money will be transferred to your account. Why Break Your FD: Choose An FD Based Credit Card In the world of financial choices, breaking your Fixed Deposit (FD) can be difficult. But why choose between growth and immediate needs? Here is a solution: opt for an FD-linked credit card from Kotak811 . Keep your FD intact while accessing a pre-approved credit limit. No need for premature closures. Experience financial flexibility without compromise. You can seamlessly manage expenses while preserving your FD's benefits. It's the smart way to balance your goals. Read More: Demystifying Recurring Deposit Accounts (RD) Conclusion Due to its fixed returns, fixed deposits are one of the most preferred investments among Indian investors. The term of the fixed deposit can be anything from 7 days to 10 years, depending on your needs. However, you should be aware of the penalty charges that apply to a premature withdrawal of FD if the deposit is broken before its maturity date. Even though fixed deposits are the safest option, if you decide to break them prematurely, you can still suffer losses. Therefore, you should refrain from withdrawing prematurely from your fixed deposit unless it is absolutely necessary.
